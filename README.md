# Student Loan Recommendation System with Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a recommendation system for student loan options using deep learning techniques. The goal is to provide students with personalized loan recommendations based on their individual profiles, academic background, and financial data.

## Project Overview

The notebook applies deep learning methods to analyze student data and match them with the most suitable loan options. This approach aims to enhance the decision-making process for students by leveraging historical loan repayment data, student demographics, and loan characteristics.

## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset used contains student demographic information, academic details, and financial profiles.
   - Preprocessing involves cleaning and normalizing the data to make it suitable for analysis by deep learning models.

2. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - A deep neural network is used to predict the most appropriate loan for each student based on their input features.
   - The model is trained using labeled historical data, where the outcomes represent successful loan matches.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
   - Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data and model performance.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data splitting, scaling, and evaluation metrics.
